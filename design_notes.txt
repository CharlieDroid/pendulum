This is a generator for simple planetary gears and compound planetary gears. A simple planetary gear consists of a ring gear, a sun gear, and multiple planet gears, where typically the sun is the input and the planet carrier is the output. A compound planetary gear consists of multiple simple planetary gears in so-called "Stages". Please choose which type you want to generate below.

Things to keep in mind:

This generator doesn't generate the actual gears themselves, instead it generates their teeth count so you can generate them yourself. The module has to be the same for all gears in each stage. To generate the gears, you can use one of many other generators. I highly recommend the Helical Gear Generator add-in for fusion 360 by Ross Korsky if you are using it, otherwise geargenerator.com by Abel Vincze.
