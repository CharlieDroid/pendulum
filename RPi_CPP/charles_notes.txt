mlpack lib needs armadillo, cereal, and ensmallen
check here for mlpack dependencies: https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack

CMAKE script:
include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/libs/mlpack-4.3.0/src)
include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/libs/ensmallen-2.21.0/include)
include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/libs/cereal-1.3.2/include)

The code for the RL algorithm should be clear
get observation
done = false
do action from actor with observation (time step should be after action
while not done
    *step* time (critical line)
    get new observation
    do action from actor with new observation
